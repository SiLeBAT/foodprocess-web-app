CHANGES
* any change triggers an event that instantly persists the new input
    example: user types in process name -> key stroke -> save event
    example: node is moved -> mouse is released -> save event

WORKSPACE
* the user can edit/translate the view via horizontal and vertical scroll bars
    example: elements are out of view/behind side menu -> user scrolls
* the user can use the mousewheel to zoom in and zoom out
* the workspace has a fixed minimum width and height. The height and width grows if a user places an element close to the border or outside of the workspace.

LAYOUT
